        "reason": "Both debaters presented extremely strong, well-reasoned, and logically arranged arguments that were highly relevant to the debate topic, demonstrating excellent clarity throughout. The differentiator came down to the overall strength and persuasiveness of their core arguments and a slight edge in emotional appeal. The Pro side successfully framed steeper roofs as a superior long-term investment due to enhanced protection from elements, reduced maintenance, and improved ventilation, effectively addressing the Con's points on initial cost and sustainability adaptability. While the Con side made a compelling case for the initial cost-effectiveness, versatility, and efficiency for sustainable technologies with flatter roofs, especially in modern urban contexts, the Pro's emphasis on durable, resilient protection and long-term value ultimately resonated more strongly. The Pro's refutations regarding long-term maintenance costs for flat roofs and the adaptability of sustainable technologies to steeper roofs were slightly more convincing, leading to a win for the affirmative."
